                <h3>The Fundamentals of Physics</h3>
                <p>Physics explores the principles governing the universe, from the tiniest particles to massive galaxies. Classical mechanics, developed by Isaac Newton, explains the motion of objects and introduces concepts like force, mass, and acceleration. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, dives into the behavior of particles at an atomic level, revealing counterintuitive phenomena that challenge our everyday understanding of reality. These two branches of physics provide a foundation for technological advancements, from electricity generation to space exploration.</p>
                <p>Other important topics include thermodynamics, which studies heat and energy transfer, and electromagnetism, which combines electricity and magnetism to explain phenomena like light and radiation. Understanding these fundamentals gives us insight into how energy powers everything around us.</p>

                <h3>The Building Blocks of Chemistry</h3>
                <p>Chemistry studies matter, its composition, and the reactions that transform it. The periodic table organizes elements based on their properties, providing a roadmap for understanding chemical behavior. Concepts such as atomic structure, bonding, and reactions explain how substances interact. For example, water (H₂O) forms when hydrogen and oxygen atoms bond in a fixed ratio, a principle that extends to countless compounds.</p>
                <p>Organic chemistry focuses on carbon-based compounds, crucial for life, while inorganic chemistry explores metals, minerals, and other non-organic substances. Chemistry not only explains natural processes like digestion but also enables innovations in medicine, agriculture, and materials science.</p>

                <h3>How PHP Works with HTML</h3>
                <p>PHP can be embedded within HTML to create dynamic content. Here's a basic example of using PHP within HTML to display text:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?&gt;</code></pre>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
                <p>PHP code starts with <code>&lt;?php</code> and ends with <code>?&gt;</code>. Statements end with a semicolon, and comments can be written using <code>//</code> or <code>/* */</code>.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
                <p>PHP variables start with a <code>$</code> symbol and are loosely typed. Common data types include <strong>strings</strong>, <strong>integers</strong>, <strong>booleans</strong>, and <strong>arrays</strong>.</p>
                <pre><code>$name = "EduVentures"; // string
$age = 20; // integer
$isStudent = true; // boolean
$subjects = array("PHP", "HTML", "CSS"); // array</code></pre>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Control Structures</h3>
                <p>PHP uses common control structures like <strong>if</strong>, <strong>else</strong>, <strong>switch</strong>, and <strong>loops</strong> for handling conditions and iterations:</p>
                <pre><code>if ($age &gt;= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
} else {
    echo "You are a minor.";
}</code></pre>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Functions allow you to create reusable blocks of code. Here’s an example:</p>
                <pre><code>function greet($name) {
    return "Hello, " . $name . "!";
}
echo greet("EduVentures");</code></pre>

                <h3>Form Validation Basics</h3>
                <p>Form validation is essential for securing and managing user input. A typical function for sanitizing data looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>function test_input($data) {
    $data = trim($data);
    $data = stripslashes($data);
    $data = htmlspecialchars($data);
    return $data;
}</code></pre>
                <p>This function removes whitespace, slashes, and converts special characters to prevent XSS attacks.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Connecting to a Database</h3>
                <p>PHP often interacts with databases, especially MySQL, for storing and retrieving data. You can connect using:</p>
                <pre><code>$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}</code></pre>
                <p>Always handle connection errors to improve your app's stability.</p>

                <h3>Using Sessions in PHP</h3>
                <p>Sessions store user-specific information across pages. Start a session with <code>session_start()</code> and use session variables to track user data.</p>
                <pre><code>session_start();
$_SESSION["username"] = "EduVenturesUser";</code></pre>
